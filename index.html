    <h2>Raja Ampat Islands: Pieces of Paradise</h2>
	  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/EQmc86tishM" target="new"><img src="images/Image3.webp" alt="" width="250" class="right_image"/></a>Far away from city skyscrapers, from dense and hectic concrete jungles, traffic congestions, flickering electric billboards, endless annoying noises, and nuisances of modern cities, the pristine paradise  of Raja Amat islands awaits, located on the far eastern side of Indonesia, off the coast of Papua. With spectacular wonders above and beyond its waters, as on land and amidst thick jungles, Raja Ampat is truly the ultimate destination for those seeking serenity, beauty and peace.

<br> <br> Literally meaning ‘The Four Kings’, Raja Ampat covers 9.8 million acres of land and sea, comprising over 1,500 small islands, cays, and shoals surrounding the four main islands of Waigeo, Batanta, Salawati, and Misool. Home to over 540 types of corals, more than 1,000 types of coral fish and around 700 types of mollusks, the overwhelming underwater wonders of raja Ampat will render any diver and snorkeler stunned with amazement.

<br> <br> 
Meanwhile, the landscape above the surface is equally breathtaking. As if carefully designed and placed with much aesthetic care, the rock islets amidst the clear blue water and bright blue skies above offer a most spectacular scenery one will ever see. Aside from its endless fascinating natural attractions, Raja Ampat also offers the distinct hospitality of the Papuan people with their unique cultural traditions.</p>
