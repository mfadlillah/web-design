	<h1>Getting to Indonesia</h1>
	  
	  <h2>Am I familiar with the visa and immigration policies of Indonesia?</h2>
	  <p>Before departing on your exciting adventure across the various wonders of Indonesia, be sure you have all the necessary travel documents that you will need to bring along on your trip. It will also be wise if you are well aware of all the information regarding immigration and visas to Indonesia from your home country to avoid all the unnecessary inconveniences.</p>
	  
	  <h2>What are the easiest ways for me to get to Indonesia by air?</h2>
    <p>The principal gateways for entry to Indonesia are Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang (just at the outskirt of Jakarta) and Bali’s Ngurah Rai International Airport. Both have undergone massive expansion and are now equipped with the latest and most convenient facilities. Other Airports that also serve international flights include Juanda Airport in Surabaya, Hasanudin Airport in Makassar, and Kuala Namu in Medan. The recently established West Java International Airport in Majalengka, West Java Province about 68Km from Bandung also serves numerous international flights.
		  <br> <br>
Travel to Indonesia from the Americas can take as little as 20 hours and requires at least a transit in East Asia, Europe or the Middle East. Travel from most of Europe will take less than 20 hours. While there are direct flights to Jakarta from Amsterdam, London and Istanbul, for other cities a transit is required. Australia, though, is just 4–7 hours away. There are several flights from various cities in the Middle East to Indonesia. There are also short flights from Indonesian cities to nearby Malaysian cities, such as from Pontianak to Kuching, Tarakan to Tawau, and Pekanbaru to Malacca.
Garuda Indonesia, the flag carrier of Indonesia, serves flights to several cities in Southeast Asia, East Asia, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Amsterdam, and London. The airline also has extensive code-sharing agreements (Sky Team) and this assists in providing good flight frequencies from airports in countries near Indonesia.
		  <br> <br>
Other international airlines that serve to and from Indonesia include AirAsia. Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, Emirates, Eva Air, Firefly, Japan Airlines, KLM, Korean Air, Lion Air, Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines, and Qantas/Jetstar Airways.</p>
